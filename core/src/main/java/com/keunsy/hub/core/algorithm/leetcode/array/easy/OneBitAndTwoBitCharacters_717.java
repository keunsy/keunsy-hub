/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/description/
 *
 *
 * We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
 *
 * Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * bits = [1, 0, 0]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
 * Output: False
 * Explanation:
 * The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
 * bits[i] is always 0 or 1.
 *
